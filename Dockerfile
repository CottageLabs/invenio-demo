# Dockerfile that builds a fully functional image of your app.
#
# This image installs all Python dependencies for your application. It's based
# on Almalinux (https://github.com/inveniosoftware/docker-invenio)
# and includes Pip, Pipenv, Node.js, NPM and some few standard libraries
# Invenio usually needs.
#
# Note: It is important to keep the commands in this file in sync with your
# bootstrap script located in ./scripts/bootstrap.
